# About me

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [lab of Jan Hasenauer](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/group-members/hasenauer-group) where my research revolves around the interfaces of Life sciences, Mathematics and Computer Science. I am developing mechanistic models (mostly ODEs) and methods, use parameter estimation (Julia and Python) to elucidate biological processes and calibrate parameters. We apply artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques as well, and make use of recent advancements in bioinformatics to shed light on the interplay and ramifications of dynamical biological processes in a data-driven manner. We develop applications and pipelines for the statistical analysis and visualization (R, Javascript/Typescript) of large-scale data as well as for knowledge representation and reasoning on metadata using semantic web technologies (e.g. ontology design, SPARQL and Neo4j) arising in biology and related sciences. 

In the past I worked mostly in the field of Computational Neuroscience up to the 2020s. In particular I employed and developed novel numerical methods for modelling and simulation of intracellular ion dynamics in neurons by PDE and ODE systems on high-performance compute infrastructure and on heterogeneous infrastructure using GPU programming on NVIDIA GPUs. I have most experience in C++/C and Lua, Python, Java as well as CUDA and cg shader programming and C# for Unity VR framework, in particular for scientific data visualization and interactive data-analysis. I developed novel numerical models for multi-scale and hybrid-dimensional phenomena in Computational Neuroscience and novel mesh generation methods for the study of intracellular Calcium waves, neuronal plasticity and memory formation.
