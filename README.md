### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - I am an Applied Mathematician working at the interface of Neuroscience, Molecular Biology and Computational Sciences

I'm looking to collaborate on projects in the field of Computational Neuroscience and Applied Mathematics, in particular using numerical methods of simulations and modelling using partial differential equations on high-performance infrastructure or mixed-compute infrastructure using GPUs.

Contact information will be made available soon below.
