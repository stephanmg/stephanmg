# About me

After my postdoc stages as detailed below, I'm currently in the process of transitioning from pure academia to R&D industry. An excerpt of my works are showcased below. I'm mainly interested in applying novel and established mathematical tools in the field of systems biology for investigating pre-clinical and translational research in the life sciences.

If my background and skills match your company's profile, I would be happy to connect - please reach out via the contact information below.

Up to the 2026, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [lab of Jan Hasenauer](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/group-members/hasenauer-group) where my research revolves around the interfaces of life sciences, mathematics and computer science. We developed mechanistic models (ODE/PDEs) and applied methods of parameter estimation in Julia/Python to calibrate models and to shed light on the interplay / ramifications of dynamical biological processes in cells in the special research fields [BATenergy](https://www.trr333.uni-bonn.de/) and [Metaflammation](https://www.sfb1454-metaflammation.de/). Therefore we leveraged AI-tools, artificial neural networks/deep learning approaches and recent advances in bioinformatics on high-performance computing infrastructure. We developed pipelines for statistical data analysis and visualization (R/Python, Javascript/Typescript) of large-scale data sets, knowledge representation and reasoning on metadata using semantic web technologies (graph databases, SPARQL, ontologies in OWL format) focusing on reusability, repeatability and reproducibility. 

I've actively maintained / contributed to the following repositories:
- https://github.com/ICB-DCM/pyABC - a framework for distributed, likelihood-free inference
- https://github.com/stephanmg/calorimetry - an application for analysis of indirect calorimetry datasets
- https://github.com/ICB-DCM/pyPESTO - a python Parameter EStimation TOolbox

Up to 2020 I have been working in the field of computational neuroscience under supervision of the [Queisser lab](https://sites.temple.edu/queisser/). I developed novel numerical methods and grid generation tools for modelling and simulation of spatially-resolved intracellular ion dynamics in neurons by PDEs/ODEs on HPC/HTC infrastructure. We made use of GPU programming on NVIDIA GPUs through CUDA/cg shader programming for interactively visualizing and numerical analysis of scientific data sets in the virtual reality framework Unity VR (C#). Major programming experience stems from C++/C and Lua, Java and Python. I developed prior to that also numerical models for multi-scale and hybrid-dimensional phenomena in molecular dynamics/computational neuroscience and mesh generation methods for the study of intracellular Calcium waves, neuronal plasticity and memory formation. 

I have been a contributor to the following repositories:
- https://github.com/c2m2/Neuro-VISOR/ - Virtual Interactive Simulation Of Reality for simulation of neuronal dynamics
- https://github.com/ug4 - UG4 simulation framework. Solving differential equations on unstructured finite element grids.
