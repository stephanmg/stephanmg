# About me

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [lab of Jan Hasenauer](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/group-members/hasenauer-group) where my research revolves around the interface of Life sciences, Mathematics and Computer Science. I am developing mechanistic models and methods, use parameter estimation to identify biological processes and make use of recent advancements in bioinformatics to shed light on the interplay and ramifications of dynamical biological processes from various data. We develop applications and pipelines for the statistical analysis and visualization of large-scale data as well as for knowledge representation and reasoning on metadata using semantic web technologies arising in biology and related sciences. 

In the past I worked mostly in the field of Computational Neuroscience up to the 2020s. In particular I employed and developed novel numerical methods for modelling and simulation of intracellular ion dynamics in neurons by using partial and ordinary differential equations (systems) on high-performance compute infrastructure and on heterogeneous infrastructure. I have experience in CUDA and shader programming for Unity, in particular for scientific data visualization and interactive data-analysis. I developed novel numerical models for multi-scale and hybrid-dimensional phenomena in Computational Neuroscience and novel mesh generation methods for the study of intracellular Calcium waves, neuronal plasticity and memory formation.
