# About me

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [lab of Jan Hasenauer][(https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/de/group-members-de)](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/group-members/hasenauer-group) where my research revolves around the interface of Life sciences, Mathematics and Computer Science. I am developing models and methods to shed light on the sophisticated metabolic network, interplay and ramifications on the level of the organism in the realm of the emerging field of metaflammation.

For the past ten years I worked mostly in the field of Computational Neuroscience. In particular I employed and developed novel numerical methods for modelling and simulation of intracellular ion dynamics in neurons by using partial and ordinary differential equations (systems) on high-performance compute infrastructure and on heterogeneous infrastructure. I have experience in CUDA and shader programming for Unity, in particular for scientific data visualization and interactive data-analysis. I developed novel numerical models for multi-scale and hybrid-dimensional phenomena in Computational Neuroscience and novel mesh generation methods for the study of intracellular Calcium waves, neuronal plasticity and memory formation.
