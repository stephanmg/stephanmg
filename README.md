# About me

I'm a postdoctoral fellow in the [lab of Jan Hasenauer](https://www.mathematics-and-life-sciences.uni-bonn.de/en/group-members/hasenauer-group) where my research revolves around the interfaces of life sciences, mathematics and computer science. We develop mechanistic models (ODE/PDEs) and apply methods of parameter estimation (Julia/Python) for model calibration to shed light on the interplay and ramifications of dynamical biological processes in cells. Therfore also AI-tools, artificial neural networks/DL approaches and recent advances in bioinformatics are exploited. We develop pipelines for statistical data analysis and visualization (R/Python, Javascript/Typescript) of large-scale data sets, knowledge representation and reasoning on metadata using semantic web technologies (graph databases, SPARQL, ontologies) focusing and reusability and reproducibility in the life sciences. 

Up to the 2020s I have been working in the field of computational neuroscience. I developed novel numerical methods and grid generation tools for modelling and simulation of spatially-resolved intracellular ion dynamics in neurons by PDEs/ODEs on HPC/HTC infrastructure. We made use of GPU programming on NVIDIA GPUs through CUDA/cg shader programming for interactively visualizing and numerical analysis of scientific data sets in the virtual reality framework Unity VR (C#). Major programming experience stems from C++/C and Lua, Java and Python. I developed prior to that also numerical models for multi-scale and hybrid-dimensional phenomena in molecular dynamics/computational neuroscience and mesh generation methods for the study of intracellular Calcium waves, neuronal plasticity and memory formation.
